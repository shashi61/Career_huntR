# Career HuntR

### Project Description -  Track Your Job Search
Job searching is a full time job. Job seekers tend to not keep a track of the number 
of jobs applied, which in turn becomes a difficult task for the job seeker to remember

the user to keep track of job applications, their interviews as well as the record of 
unanswered applications.
